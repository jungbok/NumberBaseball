On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are STRIKES, if in different positions, they are BALLS. Example: Secret number: 4271 Opponent's try: 1234 Answer: 1 Strike and 2 Balls. (The Strike is 2, the Balls are 4 and 1.)The first one to reveal the other's secret number in the least number of guesses wins the game.")
